# ESO Guild helper for Discord

This is a discord bot for helping with many things that are required to run a guild.
This bots to aim in helping event planning, guild raffles, trial planning, and other things
that are needed along the way. Of course a bot would not be complete without a couple of easter
eggs. Please see the changelog for changes and I will list the features in the README in the future.
